# Expenses and Income Tracking App

## Overview

This Flutter app allows users to track their expenses and income with features such as categorization by date, secure storage of data, and an intuitive user interface for viewing and managing financial records.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Stores financial records securely using encrypted storage.
- **Date-based Categorization**: Groups expenses and income by date.
- **User Interface**: Provides dropdowns for date selection and lists expenses and incomes with details.
- **Detailed Views**: Navigate to detailed views for individual records.
- **No Data Animation**: Displays an animation when no data is available.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (version 3.0.0 or later recommended).
- Dart SDK installed.
- An IDE such as Android Studio or VS Code.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   This package is used for securely storing sensitive data.

2. **Asset Files**
